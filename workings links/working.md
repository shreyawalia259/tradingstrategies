## A Step-by-Step Implementation of a Trading Strategy in Python using ARIMA + GARCH models 

* **Link:** https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/a-step-by-step-implementation-of-a-trading-strategy-in-python-using-arima-garch-models-b622e5b3aa39 
* **Implementation Method:** Python implementation of ARIMA + Garch which is the improvement on Arima And Garch applied in R
* **Data:** S&P Index from 1950-December 2020
* **Summary:** Uses Arima model to fit the log of the closing statement each day and then uses GARCH to fit the residuals from ARIMA. Takes the sum of those to then compare against cumulative gains which is calculative through a cumulative sum of the log of closing values. 
In R and Python, Arima model was fit by looping through several hyper-parameters and choosing lowest AIC. Through the Arima and Garch forecasts, signals are created. Our strategy will simply long the position if the prediction is 1 (up) and short if the prediction is -1 (down). 
* **Code: Arima+Garch. Sp500_forecasts file needed for the signal**

  *	Useful resource for pulling data and plotting it using common trading strategies such as MACD. 
  *	Good as a starting point. 
* **Libraries required:** Talib, mplfinance 
* **Code: Technical Analysis Visualization**

* **Link:** https://medium.com/dataseries/deepmind-open-sourced-this-new-architecture-to-improve-long-term-memory-in-deep-learning-systems-dab7ed82986f
* **Summary/Findings:** Talks about deep learning systems and mentions LSTM model and its advantages or disadvantages. Good for people who know about artificial neural networks already. A very brief article though I do not think it has much learning potential.

* **Link: https://medium.com/python-in-plain-english/4-python-libraries-to-help-you-make-money-from-webscraping-57ba6d8ce56d
* **Summary/Findings:** It is good for learning basic webscraping using beautiful soup or selenium. However for finance specifically since there is yfinance library that easily pulls data from yahoo, not sure how useful it is. 
* **Libraries:** selenium, bs4
* **Note:** for selenium you need to get the library, get chrome driver and all of that so it is easier to just use bs4.

* **Link:** https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-create-a-dashboard-to-dominate-the-stock-market-using-python-and-dash-c35a12108c93
* **Summary/Findings:** Helpful for dashboard but very lengthy code to pull live data to create a dashboard. I feel like other resources show easier ways, this is just more visually pleasing. No trading strategies mentioned and uses data from twitter and reddit than calculating any key performance indicators. 
* **Libraries:** Tweepy(twitter), praw(Reddit), dash, dashbootstrap components, flask, plotly

* **Summary/Findings:** They refer to part 1 about data collection however there is no link to it, so finding data used is tricky. However, this author has several similar articles to look at regarding trading strategies. This part focuses on ML algorithms and hyper -parameter optimization
* **Financial Factors explored:** Variance inflation factor (VIF), Ease of Movement (EVM), Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average (MA)
* **Notes:** Other articles are better sources since they target most of these factors while also including data collection within the same source and better explanation of implementing code.
