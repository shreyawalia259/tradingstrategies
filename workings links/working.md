**Title: A Step-by-step Implementation of a Trading Strategy in Python using ARIMA + GARCH models

Link: https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/a-step-by-step-implementation-of-a-trading-strategy-in-python-using-arima-garch-models-b622e5b3aa39 
Implementation Method: Python implementation of ARIMA + Garch which is the improvement on Arima And Garch applied in R
Data: S&P Index from 1950-December 2020
Summary: Uses Arima model to fit the log of the closing statement each day and then uses GARCH to fit the residuals from ARIMA. Takes the sum of those to then compare against cumulative gains which is calculative through a cumulative sum of the log of closing values. 
In R and Python, Arima model was fit by looping through several hyper-parameters and choosing lowest AIC. Through the Arima and Garch forecasts, signals are created. Our strategy will simply long the position if the prediction is 1 (up) and short if the prediction is -1 (down). 
Code: Arima+Garch. Sp500_forecasts file needed for the signal


**Title: Python For Trading: An Introduction

Link: https://blog.quantinsti.com/python-trading/
Method: Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
Performance Evaluation
•	Annualised return,
•	Annualised volatility, and
•	Sharpe ratio.
Has a good explanation from libraries to download to moving averages. Simple strategy to follow and how to check its performance. Good introduction for someone who is new to this but has basic python knowledge. 
**Code: MACD strategy.

Title: Building a Technical Analysis Chart with Python
Method: Building MACD, MA10,MA30 and RSI charts
•	Used talib library to get MACD, MA10,MA30 and RSI. Very useful and easy. 
•	Useful resource for pulling data and plotting it using common trading strategies such as MACD. 
•	Good as a starting point. 
Libraries required: Talib, mplfinance

Title: DeepMind Open Sourced This New Architecture to Improve Long-Term Memory in Deep Learning Systems
Summary/Findings: Talks about deep learning systems and mentions LSTM model and its advantages or disadvantages. Good for people who know about artificial neural networks already. A very brief article though I do not think it has much learning potential.

Title: 4 Python Libraries to Help you Make Money from Webscraping
Summary/Findings: It is good for learning basic webscraping using beautiful soup or selenium. However for finance specifically since there is yfinance library that easily pulls data from yahoo, not sure how useful it is. 
Libraries: selenium, bs4
Note: for selenium you need to get the library, get chrome driver and all of that so it is easier to just use bs4.

Title: How to Create a Dashboard to Dominate the Stock Market Using Python and Dash
Summary/Findings: Helpful for dashboard but very lengthy code to pull live data to create a dashboard. I feel like other resources show easier ways, this is just more visually pleasing. No trading strategies mentioned and uses data from twitter and reddit than calculating any key performance indicators. 
Libraries: Tweepy(twitter), praw(Reddit), dash, dashbootstrap components, flask, plotly

Title: Intrinsic Valuation of Stocks Using Python
Summary/findings: Purpose of this article is to help create a discounted cash flow model in python to calculate intrinsic value of a company. This helps to see whether or not a company is overvalued which can give help information for trading. Not exactly a trading strategy but good exploration of things that are impactful for stock market. 
**Code: Evaluation.

Title: Time-Series Data Analysis & Machine Learning Algorithm for Stock Trading
Summary/Findings: They refer to part 1 about data collection however there is no link to it, so finding data used is tricky. However, this author has several similar articles to look at regarding trading strategies. This part focuses on ML algorithms and hyper -parameter optimization
Financial Factors explored: Variance inflation factor (VIF), Ease of Movement (EVM), Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average (MA)
Notes: Other articles are better sources since they target most of these factors while also including data collection within the same source and better explanation of implementing code.
