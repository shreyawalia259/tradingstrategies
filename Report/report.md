# Generating Materials on Trading Strategies: Spring 2021


## The Objective
The first thing discussed was the articles that Professor Huo had collected on trading strategies and visualizing important stock metrics in Python. The goal was decided to be a thorough evaluation of each article to check for reproducibility and teaching abilities. Out of that, a second goal was to possibly generate some teaching module for a financial analysis class if the sources provided concrete learning examples and aids.

### Introduction 

<h3>

### Finding Reproduceable Articles 
For each article, I read through it to check the teaching ability of the explanantions and an example of the strategy they applied. I then checked if their implementation in  Python was still reproduceable. Then, I organized all of this into a github repository called trading strategies. Here, I had a readable file with the link, title, summary, and information on reproducibility of the code. I even gave comments on if their article could be used as a teaching resource itself. 

I then created a file, with information on how to download the different libraries or packages needed to run the provided code. I even wrote a simple guide on how to use libraries such as Yfinance and Ta-LIB that are very popular among people evaluating trading strategies.  After that, I created jupyter notebooks, giving information on each block of code and what its function was. Aslo included, was a breifing on the dataset being used so that people using the case study of the strategy could play around the data themselves and gain a better understanding of how and why the implementation works and can be successful. Using each case study that was reproduceable, I also had a small guide on each strategy being used, how it works and the concepts associated with it.
