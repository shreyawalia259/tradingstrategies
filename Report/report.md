# Generating Materials on Trading Strategies: Spring 2021


## The Objective
* Evaluating existing trading strategies implemented in Python to potentially create a teaching module for a financial data analysis course.
* Looking into creating a dashboard tracking stock performance and strategy performance.

### Introduction

### Finding Reproduceable Articles 
First, I had a list of articles through work through provided and collected by Professor Huo. These articles consisted of various trading strategies that were mostly implemented in Python such as moving averages or using ARIMA models to forecast. For each article, I read through it to check the teaching ability of the explanantions and an example of the strategy they applied. I then checked if their implementation in  Python was still reproduceable. This is because a lot of authors used outdated packages that either were not supported anymore or did not work with an updated website. Or there were some that had errors in the code. I also needed to check for which implementations called for too mnay installations or data preparation and collection because the objective was to look for simpler implementations that work just as well. 
All of this information went into the github repository in the folder called Working links. 
Then, I organized all of this into a github repository called trading strategies. Here, I had a readable file with the link, title, summary, and information on reproducibility of the code. I even gave comments on if their article could be used as a teaching resource itself. 

I then created a file, with information on how to download the different libraries or packages needed to run the provided code. I even wrote a simple guide on how to use libraries such as Yfinance and Ta-LIB that are very popular among people evaluating trading strategies.  After that, I created jupyter notebooks, giving information on each block of code and what its function was. Aslo included, was a breifing on the dataset being used so that people using the case study of the strategy could play around the data themselves and gain a better understanding of how and why the implementation works and can be successful. Using each case study that was reproduceable, I also had a small guide on each strategy being used, how it works and the concepts associated with it.
