# Generating Materials on Trading Strategies: Spring 2021

# Introduction and Objectives 
In this project, we have two objectives. First, we focus on finding strategies that could give a general idea of when would be a good time to buy, hold or sell your stocks. Second, we focus finding data visualization techniques that would help visualize and analyze stock performance based on metrics such as RSI. 

It should be noted that, the above two objectives are achieved by the existing resources. And we basically find resources that provide easy-to-use and accessible information on capturing the trends in stock prices.

# Preparation before the Analysis
The first step in starting this project is finding sources that try to tackle these problems and solve them successfully. The sources evaluated and used in the project were provided by Professor Huo in the form of articles where people report on their version of popular trading strategies. The first thing to check in evaluating each resource is looking at the reporducibility of their code. We do not consider the code which is outdated, or the websites they use is outdated, or the libraries is hard to find, because these material is not accessible to anyone and the point of this
project

This evaluation is noted down in the source evaluation file in the appendix of the github repository where all the articles are divided into two sections: Reproducible and Non-Reproducible. 

# Analysis results
After getting the main category down, I wrote a summary for each article talking about the main goals of the author whether they were implementing a strategy, teaching basic analysis of performance metrics or focusing on the visualization of those performance metrics. I also took note of what strategy they were using and what external libraries were needed to run their code successfully. Lastly, I identified the articles that were a good teaching resource separately because of the end goal of possibly using these articles to create a teaching module.

These summaries of each article was then added to their respective codes as well so that the reader could have a good understanding of what they were running.

As stated, the code from each source has a summary at the beginning for understanding what the function of the code is. To further explain all the steps, I added an explanation for each step in the code so that it is easy to follow. It also makes it easier to understand how certain functions work and how to use them even if the user had never seen them before.

## Installation 
In reproducing the results, I ran all the code from the authors' github in Jupyter Notebooks. I quickly realized that a lot of the libraries needed to be installed on my device still in order to run the code. Upon coming across that obstacle, I created an installations file where I put down the installation commands for each required libraries for all the repsective case studies. So the user would have to run this file once and they could easily work on any case study they wanted after.

# Additional Contributions

## Discovery of two excellent libraries
### Library 1: Yfinance
### Library 2: Ta-lib
One thing I noticed from the articles is that several of them used the Yfinance library to pull data on stock open, close, high and low prices instead of scraping through the website information. This method looked really simple with a lot of customization options using tickers such as pulling data in 30 minute intervals or monthly or annually. Hence, I created a simple guide on how to install this library, how to use Tickers to pull data and how to convert it into a dataframe to manipulate the data easily.

Another library included in that guide is the Technical Analysis Library(Ta-lib). This library is extremely useful in calculating MACD signal and histogram in one line of code and other such measures. For example any kind of moving average, simple or exponential. And since it can caculate the MACD signal and histogram it is really easy to plot the calculations and see when you should keep or sell your stocks without having to put too much of user effort in. So, I included an installation and use guide for this library too since it is so helpful in implementing any trading strategies and visualizing them. 

## Development of two Teaching Modules
Since a possible outcome of collecting all the articles and their reproducible code is to create a teaching module from it, I created two examples of teaching modules that can be constructed. One example is teaching all theory first and then including the case studies as something to experiment with and learn application of the taught theory. The other idea includes focusing on each case study indidvually and learning about each tool or technique as it comes in each example.

These ideas are very roughly organized since this is a possible outcome in the future and not a direct result of the project immediately. 

## Creation of Dashboard
This objective was an added later in the semester. The main purpose of it was to learn how to create a simple dashboard and have a brief guide in it. The starting point of this project was looking at the dashboard created by GaTech CS students. From there I worked on creating a simpler version of the dashboard where I included covid new cases data that updated daily and included projected forecasts by either a research intitute or any other source.

In my research, I found that a lot of people preffered tableau for this sort of implementation and was able to find a guide on the tableau website on how one could create a dashboard containing covid data. I downloaded their example case study and the data from the same source they got theirs. Once I had these two things, I tried to create my own dashboard in tableau that was essentially a replication of the case study they provided. Since this was an additionaly thing to work on and not the original outcome, I have not reached the stage of creating a guide yet. My progress has been learning how to create plots in Tableau and put them in your final dashboard. I stopped just short of adding the projected forecasts of the number of new cases. 

# Further Works
In the future maybe someone can work on finding more articles or authors to create a wholistic study guide and be able to fully convert the found materials into a teaching module so that students or any other user can access it and learn a great deal from it.
