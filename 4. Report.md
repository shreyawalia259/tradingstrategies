# Generating Materials on Trading Strategies: Spring 2021

# Introduction and Objectives 
It is useful to predict stock trends in the near future because it helps us to make profits by buying/sell at the right time. However, stocks can be very volatile and unexpected, which lead to values that no one saw coming.

In this project, we have two objectives. First, we focus on finding strategies that could give a general idea of when would be a good time to buy, hold or sell your stocks. Second, we focus finding data visualization techniques that would help visualize and analyze stock performance based on metrics such as RSI. 

It should be noted that, the above two objectives are achieved by the existing resources. And we basically find resources that provide easy-to-use and accessible information on capturing the trends in stock prices.

# Preparation before the Analysis
The first step in starting this project is finding sources that try to tackle these problems and solve them successfully. The sources evaluated and used in the project are provided by Professor Huo in the form of articles where people report on their version of popular trading strategies. The first thing to check in evaluating each resource is looking at the reporducibility of their code. We do not consider the code which is outdated, or the websites they use is outdated, or the libraries is hard to find, because these material is not accessible to anyone and the point of this
project

This evaluation is noted down in the source evaluation file in the appendix of the github repository where all the articles are divided into two sections: Reproducible and Non-Reproducible.

# Analysis results
After noting down the main distinction, I wrote a summary for each article talking about the main goals of the author whether they were implementing a strategy, teaching basic analysis of performance metrics or focusing on the visualization of those performance metrics. I also took a note of what strategy is being using and what external libraries are needed to run their code successfully. Lastly, I identified and separated the articles that are a good teaching resource because of the end goal of possibly using these articles to create a teaching module.

These summaries of each articles are then added to their respective codes as well, so that the reader could have a good understanding of what code they are running.

As stated, the code from each source includes a summary at the beginning for understanding what the function of the code is. To further explain all the steps, I added an explanation for each step in the code so that it is easy to follow. It also makes it easier to understand how certain functions work and how to use them even if the user had never seen them before.

## Installation 
In reproducing the results, I ran all the code from the authors' github in Jupyter Notebooks. I quickly realized that a lot of the libraries needed to be installed on my device still in order to run the code. Upon coming across that obstacle, I created an installations file where I put down the installation commands for each required libraries for all the repsective case studies. So the user can run this file once which will enable them to easily work on any case study they want without errors.

## Analysis results of 7 cases studies
### Case Study 1: A Step-by-Step Implementation of a Trading Strategy in Python using ARIMA + GARCH models
#### Background: Takes inspiration from an existing case study where the author applies ARIMA+Garch models to the closing price of stocks to forecast a signal for future buying or selling of the stock.
#### Objective: To compare annual returns from ARIMA + GARCH implementation in python with a previous implementation of ARIMA and GARCH models in R by another author.
#### Technique: Uses Arima model to fit the log of the closing statement each day and then uses GARCH to fit the residuals from ARIMA. Takes the sum of those to then compare against cumulative gains which is calculated through a cumulative sum of the log of closing values.

### Case Study 2: Intrinsic Valuation of Stocks Using Python
#### Background: A Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model helps to see whether or not a company is overvalued which can give helpful information to use in trading. 
#### Objective: Purpose of this article is to help create a discounted cash flow model for the next 5 years in python to calculate intrinsic value of a company.
#### Technique: Uses growth rate, ebit margin and tax rate to calculate Sales, EBIT- Operating Income, Tax Expense, NOPAT, D&A Expense, Capital Expenditures, Increase in NWC, Free Cash Flow for the next 5 years.

### Case Study 3: Python For Trading: An Introduction
#### Background: Downloading helpful libraries such as yfinance and knowing how to apply simple trading strategies in Python can go a long way in actually implementing your own strategies. Hence, this article aims to teach users how to do exactly that.  
#### Objective: Acquainting users with Python to better their own trading strategy.
#### Technique: This particular case study uses Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) to create a trading signal and tests it using Sharpe Ratio, Annual Growth Rate and annual Volatility. 

### Case Study 4: Building a Technical Analysis Chart with Python
#### Background: Trading platforms can have several limitations such as parameters for indicators that are too strict and not customizable. Hence, it is helpful to know how to calculate and plot metrics you deem important. 
#### Objective: Using Python to build technical analysis charts from scratch so that it is customizable to users needs. 
#### Technique: Uses talib library to get MACD, MA10,MA30 and RSI and plot the charts for the calculated averages. 

### Case Study 5: Trading Dashboard Pt.2 — Yfinance & Python.
#### Background: Helpful guide to creating a dashboard which can help user compare stocks and their key indicators. 
#### Objective: Providing the average retail investor with a quick and easy way to pull live data, use that data to highlight key indicators and create a nice clean readable table before investing in a particular company.
#### Technique: Uses the square root and mean of the closing price of desired stock from all stock history to calculate and display annual returns, annual volatility and sharpe ratio.

### Case Study 6: Crash Course — Python & Pandas for Trading and Investing (Part 1)
#### Background: Python and Pandas make it pretty easy to analyze and visualize time series data, even if you’re a beginner. Hence, this article uses Pandas to visualize and analyze stock trends. 
#### Objective: Crash Course that teaches:
1. Importing packages
2. Making a random time series
3. Transforming data to make new columns
4. Creating logical conditions and visualizing them as signals
#### Technique: Uses Pandas to generate a random time series and calculate moving averages to analyze stock trends.

### Case Study 7: Making a Stock Screener with Python!
#### Background: Stock Screeners are a wonderful way to find the perfect stocks for your specific trading strategy. However, when the author tried looking to find a stock screener using Python, he could hardly find any functional, automated code.
#### Objective: To help others make an easy-to-follow stock screener Python program based on Mark Minervini’s Trend Template (the 8 principles on selecting the best stocks).
#### Technique: Uses pandas to calculate important metrics and screen stocks based on the criterion listed below:
1. The current price of the security must be greater than the 150 and 200-day simple moving averages.
2. The 150-day simple moving average must be greater than the 200-day simple moving average.
3. The 200-day simple moving average must be trending up for at least 1 month.
4. The 50-day simple moving average must be greater than the 150 simple moving average and the 200 simple moving average.
5. The current price must be greater than the 50-day simple moving average.
6. The current price must be at least 30% above the 52 week low.
7. The current price must be within 25% of the 52 week high.
8. The IBD RS-Rating must be greater than 70 (the higher, the better).



# Additional Contributions

## Discovery of two excellent libraries
### Library 1: Yfinance
One thing to observe from the articles is that several of them used the Yfinance library to pull data on stock open, close, high and low prices instead of scraping through the website information. This method looked really simple with a lot of customization options using tickers such as pulling data in 30 minute intervals or monthly or annually. Hence, I created a simple guide on how to install this library, how to use Tickers to pull data and how to convert it into a dataframe to manipulate the data easily.
### Library 2: Ta-lib
Another library included in that guide is the Technical Analysis Library(Ta-lib). This library is extremely useful in calculating MACD signal and histogram in one line of code and other such measures. For example any kind of moving average, simple or exponential. And since it can caculate the MACD signal and histogram it is really easy to plot the calculations and see when you should keep or sell your stocks without having to put too much of user effort in. So, an installation and use guide exists for this library too since it is so helpful in implementing any trading strategies and visualizing them. 

## Development of Two Teaching Modules
Since a possible outcome of collecting all the articles and their reproducible code is to create a teaching module from it, I created two examples of teaching modules that can be constructed. One example is teaching all theory first and then including the case studies as something to experiment with and learn application of the taught theory. The other idea includes focusing on each case study indidvually and learning about each tool or technique as it comes in each example.

These ideas are very briefly noted down since this is a possible outcome in the future and not a direct result of the project immediately. 

## Creation of Dashboard
This objective is an additional objective. The main purpose of it is to learn how to create a simple dashboard and have a brief guide on it. The starting point of this project is looking at the dashboard created by GaTech CS students. From there I have been working on creating a simpler version of the dashboard where I included covid new cases data that updated daily and included projected forecasts by either a research intitute or any other source.

In my research, I found that a lot of people preferred tableau for this sort of implementation and was able to find a guide on the tableau website on how one could create a dashboard containing covid data. I downloaded their example case study and the data from the same source they got theirs. Once I had these two things, I tried to create my own dashboard in tableau that is essentially a replication of the case study provided. Since this is an additionaly thing to work on and not the original outcome, I have not reached the stage of creating a guide yet. My progress has been learning how to create plots in Tableau and put them in your final dashboard. I stopped just short of adding the projected forecasts of the number of new cases. 

# Further Works
In the future, someone can work on finding more articles or authors to create a wholistic study guide and be able to fully convert the found materials into a teaching module so that students or any other user can access it and learn a great deal from it.
