# Generating Materials on Trading Strategies: Spring 2021


## The Objective
* Evaluating existing trading strategies implemented in Python to potentially create a teaching module for a financial data analysis course.
* Looking into creating a dashboard tracking stock performance and strategy performance.

### Introduction

### Finding Reproduceable Articles 
First, I had a list of articles through work through provided and collected by Professor Huo. These articles consisted of various trading strategies that were mostly implemented in Python such as moving averages or using ARIMA models to forecast. For each article, I read through it to check the teaching ability of the explanantions and an example of the strategy they applied. I then checked if their implementation in  Python was still reproduceable. This is because a lot of authors used outdated packages that either were not supported anymore or did not work with an updated website. Or there were some that had errors in the code. I also needed to check for which implementations called for too mnay installations or data preparation and collection because the objective was to look for simpler implementations that work just as well. 

All of this information went into the github repository in the folder called Working links. Here, I had a readable file with the link, title, summary, and information on reproducibility of the code. I even gave comments on if their article could be used as a teaching resource itself. 


<h3>

### Guide Creation
I then created a file, with information on how to download the different libraries or packages needed to run the provided code. I even wrote a simple guide on how to use libraries such as Yfinance and Ta-LIB that are very popular among people evaluating trading strategies in the file installation guide in the folder implementation guide. Using each case study that was reproduceable, I also had a small guide on each strategy being used, how it works and the concepts associated with it in the file trading strategies in the folder implementation guide.

<h3>

### Jupyter Notebooks
After that, I created jupyter notebooks, giving information on each block of code and what its function was. Aslo included, was a breifing on the dataset being used so that people using the case study of the strategy could play around the data themselves and gain a better understanding of how and why the implementation works.  and can be successful.

### Dashboard Implementation

### Utilizing the Github Repository
The way a person can use the github repository is by going through the working links folder and then file to find reproducible and helpful articles. Fromt here they can read a summary of the article and find a direct link to the code implemeneted in a Jupyter Notebook. Before that, they can use the installations file in the implemented examples folder to install any libraries needed. Next they can run the code and play around with it and learn about the strategy the author used. They can also read about using the yfinance and ta-lib libraries on their own for running their own strategies in Python and the theory on the strategy that the author applied.
