## Installations:
The installation file is a Jupyter notebook containing commands to run all the libraries needed to run Case Studies 1-7 successfully.
<h2>

## Case Study 1-5: 
These case studies are Jupyter notebooks containing applied strategies on stock data trends to get higher cummulative returns or ways to successfully visualiz those trends.

### Case Study 1 & sp500_forecasts:
* Link: https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/a-step-by-step-implementation-of-a-trading-strategy-in-python-using-arima-garch-models-b622e5b3aa39
* Implementation Method: Python implementation of ARIMA + Garch which is the improvement on Arima And Garch applied in R
* Data: S&P Index from 1950-December 2020
* Summary: Uses Arima model to fit the log of the closing statement each day and then uses GARCH to fit the residuals from ARIMA. Takes the sum of those to then compare against cumulative gains which is calculative through a cumulative sum of the log of closing values.
* The sp500_forecasts file is used as a signal from the baseline strategy to compare cummulative returns to the new applied strategy by case study 1.
