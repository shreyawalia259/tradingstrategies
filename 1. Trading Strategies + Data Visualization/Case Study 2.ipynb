    "* **Summary/findings:** Purpose of this article is to help create a discounted cash flow model in python to calculate intrinsic value of a company. This helps to see whether or not a company is overvalued which can give help information for trading. Not exactly a trading strategy but good exploration of things that are impactful for stock market. \n",
