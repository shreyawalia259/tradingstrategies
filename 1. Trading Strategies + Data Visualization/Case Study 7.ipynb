    "### Screen Criteria:\n",
    "1. The current price of the security must be greater than the 150 and 200-day simple moving averages.\n",
    "2. The 150-day simple moving average must be greater than the 200-day simple moving average.\n",
    "3. The 200-day simple moving average must be trending up for at least 1 month.\n",
    "4. The 50-day simple moving average must be greater than the 150 simple moving average and the 200 simple moving average.\n",
    "5. The current price must be greater than the 50-day simple moving average.\n",
    "6. The current price must be at least 30% above the 52 week low.\n",
    "7. The current price must be within 25% of the 52 week high.\n",
    "8. The IBD RS-Rating must be greater than 70 (the higher, the better). The RS rating is a metric of a stockâ€™s price performance over the last year compared to all other stocks and the overall market. Check out this article to learn more."
