# Generating Materials on Trading Strategies: Spring 2021

## Introduction 
Being able to predict stock trends in the near future can be very useful in making a profit since you buy and sell at the right times. However, stocks can be very volatile and unexpected events can lead to values that no one saw coming. 

Hence, this project focused on finding strategies that could give a general idea of when would be a good time to buy, hold or sell your stocks. Another point of focus was on finding data visualization techniques that would help visualize and analyze stock performance based on metrics such as RSI. Basically, the idea of the project was to find resources that provided easy to use and accessible information on trying to capture the trends in stock prices.

## The Objective
* Evaluating existing trading strategies implemented in Python to potentially create a teaching module for a financial data analysis course.
* Extra:Looking into creating a dashboard tracking stock performance and strategy performance.

## Working Towards the Objective 

### Step 1: Source Evaluation
The first step in starting this project was finding sources that had tried to tackle these problems before and solved them successfully. The sources evaluated and used in the project were provided by Professor Huo in the form of articles were people presented the strategies they had come up with and worked on. The first thing I checked in evaluating each resource was looking at the reporducibility of their code. Of the code was outdated, the websites they used outdated or the libraries hard to find, then it was not accessible to anyone and the point of this porject is to find examples that anyone could implement and reinvent with basic knowledge in python.

This evaluation was noted down in the source evaluation file in the appendix of the github repository where all the articles are divided into two sections: Reproducible and Non-Reproducible. 

After getting the main category down, I wrote a summary for each article talking about the main goals of the author whether they were implementing a strategy, teaching basic analysis of performance metrics or focusing on the visualization of those performance metrics. I also took note of what strategy they were using and what external libraries were needed to run their code successfully. Lastly, I identified the articles that were a good teaching resource separately because of the end goal of possibly using these articles to create a teaching module. 

These summaries of each article was then added to their respective codes as well so that the reader could have a good understanding of what they were running.

### Step 2: Reproducing Results and Annotations
In reproducing the results, I ran all the code from the authors' github in Jupyter Notebooks. I quickly realized that a lot of the libraries needed to be installed on my device still in order to run the code. Upon coming across that obstacle, I created an installations file where I put down the installation commands for each required libraries for all the repsective case studies. So the user would have to run this file once and they could easily work on any case study they wanted after.
